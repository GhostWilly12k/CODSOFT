I built a model to predict fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset with features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized attributes. As Iâ€™m new to handling imbalanced datasets, I explored the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions and visualized trends over two days. After addressing missing and duplicate data, I applied SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler to handle the imbalance and trained a Random Forest model. The performance improved after balancing the dataset, and I evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1 score, and AUPRC.
Next, I plan to fine-tune the model with hyperparameter optimization and explore techniques like Gradient Boosting to further improve accuracy. This has been a valuable learning experience in working with imbalanced datasets.
